# What I learned from this project

## Design
This is more like a neon like spaceship style. 

## HTML5 Canvas
I learnd how HTML5 canvas works. You can draw weather reactange, ellipse, bezier curve, line, point, and anything you want by the canvas WEB-APIs, like `fillRect(x, y, width, height)`, `arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, direction)` to draw circle. 


## IDE / text editor
`Vim` + `tmux` + `ranger`.
